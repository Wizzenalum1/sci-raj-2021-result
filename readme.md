>Because server is not involved in this project, so all data will going to be load at the time of first request to the web page.
To reduce processing whole data, for each query. i used cacheing.

### how to  compress data, so page loading time can be reduced.
>1. remove all unneccesory, duplicate or derivable data.
>2. apply delta compression.
>3. upload to github because github uses http compression which reduce the size to total of 4 mb approx.
