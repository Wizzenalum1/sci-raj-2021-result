# this is a result analysis web application.

At the time of result declaration of rajasthan board of 12th science i thought this is time when everyone want to compare their result so that they know where they actully lie.

## how to use this

click to this [link](https://wizzenalum1.github.io/sci-raj-2021-result)

1. select your district then select school and press get result and here you can set any range for percentage
2. if you want see whole districts result with 90 - 100 % srcorere student then don't select school and set other inputs.
3. want to see 95-100% scorer student in whole rajasthan. just put the range only and get result.

## technology used to create

1. html
2. javascript
3. css
4. web scraping
5. compression of the data
6. it not fetching any data. it load all the data with loading the application.

#### if you want make any contribution then. most welcome

this is ghanshyam ...... how whole project crated.

### Without server this page make you feel like server based webpage.

` Challenges faced as i my sister dreamed about something where she can look all other students result.`

### how to get the all data of science stream from the oficial server

> During the finding the answer to this question i learn the web scraping by making request to the server and then i become able to store all the data of science students which reads in rajasthan. and then apply some preprocessing to clean the data, and Also apply some compression.

### how data will going load because server is not involved

> Because server is not involved in this project, so all data will going to be load at the time of first request to the web page.
> To reduce processing whole data, for each query. i used cacheing.

### how to compress data, so page loading time can be reduced.

> 1.  remove all unneccesory, duplicate or derivable data.
> 2.  apply delta compression.
> 3.  upload to github because github uses http compression which reduce the size to total of 4 mb approx.

### defining the query parameters and deginging the dashboard

> instead of text input in district and school selection i created a option tab.
